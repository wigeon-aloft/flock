# Flock
Flock is a Discord bot that allows communities to manage lobbies/queues for upcoming group games and events. It allows multiple queues, scheduling and comprehensive control over queue settings.

## Setup
Create a `.env` file in the `src` directory containing an `api-token` parameter with the value of the bot's API token:

```
api-token=<TOKEN>
```
